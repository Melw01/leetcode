# Dynamic Programming

## 5 Steps to work through any DP problems
1. figure out the meaning of dp array and the pointer (should it be a 1D array or 2D array)
2. figure out the recursion equation
3. figure out what values to initiate for dp array
4. figure out the traversal order of dp elements (front --> back or back --> front)
5. print out the dp array (for debugging)
